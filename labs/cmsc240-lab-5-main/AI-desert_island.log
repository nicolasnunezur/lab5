Welcome to Desert Island!
[LOCATION: beach]
You are currently at the beach. The waves crash gently on the shore, and a warm breeze carries the scent of salt and palms.

Shipwrecked and alone, you must gather resources from the island to build a raft and escape.

You notice a large *palm leaf* lying nearby. It might be useful.
